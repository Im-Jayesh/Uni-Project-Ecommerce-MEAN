## 1. Introduction
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to design and develop an innovative and functional e-commerce platform, "Elevate Commerce Platform," focusing on user authentication, shopping cart functionality, and secure payment gateway integration. This project aims to provide a hands-on experience in building full-stack applications while addressing real-world challenges in e-commerce development.

### Background
E-commerce platforms have revolutionized the way businesses operate, enabling efficient online transactions and global customer reach. This project seeks to replicate these principles by empowering the team to develop a fundamental e-commerce platform while adhering to modern development practices.

### Scope
This project will encompass:
- User authentication (registration and login).
- Shopping cart management.
- Payment gateway integration.
- Standard e-commerce functionalities such as product listing, search, and order management.

## 2. Problem Statement
The modern e-commerce landscape demands platforms that are intuitive, reliable, and secure. This project addresses the need for creating a basic yet functional e-commerce platform that demonstrates:
